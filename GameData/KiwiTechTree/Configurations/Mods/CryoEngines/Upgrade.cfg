// Kiwi's Tech Tree Overhaul (Cryo Engines 1.1.4 by Nertea UpgradePatch)
// Version 0.9
// Created: September 2020 for KSP 1.9.1
// Last Updated: 26 October 2020
// 25 September 2020: Added NEEDS to PARTUPGRADE
// 26 October 2020: Changed KiwiAerospace to KiwiTechTree

// ***** Liquid Hydrogen / Liquid Methane ***** \\

// Tier 0 - start, just the small jet engine to allow for the aeronautics branch

// Tier 1 - basicCryoRocketry , a basic 0.625m engine that helps get us off the ground

// Tier 2 - generalCryoRocketry ; Stronger 0.625m engine and initial 1.25m engine

// Tier 3 - advancedCryoRocketry ; Intro of the 1.875m engine in Making History

// Tier 4 - heavyCryoRocketry Heavy Rocketry, Intro of 2.5m engines
