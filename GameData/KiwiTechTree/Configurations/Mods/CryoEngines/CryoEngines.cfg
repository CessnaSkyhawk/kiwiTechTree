// Kiwi's Tech Tree Overhaul (Cryo Engines 1.1.4 by Nertea Patch)
// Version 1.2
// Created: 30 August 2020 for KSP 1.9.1 to 1.10.1
// Last Updated: 25 November 2020
// 29 October 2020: Generalized the ModuleEngines Identifier in B9; Rebalanced engine ISPs
// 25 November 2020: Some code clean-up

// ***** Liquid Hydrogen / Liquid Methane ***** \\

// Tier 0 - start, just the small jet engine to allow for the aeronautics branch

// Tier 1 - basicCryoRocketry , a basic 0.625m engine that helps get us off the ground


// Tier 2 - generalCryoRocketry ; Stronger 0.625m engine and initial 1.25m engine
