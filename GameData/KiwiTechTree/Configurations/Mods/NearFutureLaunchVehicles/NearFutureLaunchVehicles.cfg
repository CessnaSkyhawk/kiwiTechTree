// Kiwi's Tech Tree Overhaul (Near Future Lauch Vehicles 2.03 by Nertea Patch)
// Version 1.0
// Created August 2020 for KSP 1.9.1
// Last Updated: 2 November 2020 
// 16 September 2020: Updated Engine Mass Upgrade
// 23 September 2020: Lowered entry cost of Otter
// 18 October 2020: Moved RCS block in flight control branch
// 29 October 2020: Generalized the ModuleEngines Identifier in B9
// 2 November 2020: Added general fuel tank upgrades, Removed CommunityTechTree from NEEDS as it is redundant
// 10 November 2020: Standardized Upgrades

// Ignore these fuel tanks in the cryotanks pass and go to the default pass
