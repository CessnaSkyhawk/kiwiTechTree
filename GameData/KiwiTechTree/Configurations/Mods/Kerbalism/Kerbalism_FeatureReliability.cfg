// Kiwi's Tech Tree Overhaul (Kerbalism by SirMortimer Stock FeatureReliability Patches)
// Version 0.9
// Created: 6 October 2020 for KSP 1.9.1
// Last Updated: 26 October 2020
// 7 October 2020: Small changes to engine reliability algorithm
// 17 October 2020: Added upgrades for solar panels and reaction wheels to make it plausible that probes with solar panels and reaction wheels will still have some functioning parts when reaching new systems. 
// 26 October 2020: Changed KiwiAerospace to KiwiTechTree
