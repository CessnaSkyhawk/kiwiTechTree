// Kiwi's Tech Tree Overhaul (Kerbalism by SirMortimer Structural Upgrades Patch)
// Version 0.9
// Created: 3 October 2020 for KSP 1.9.1
// Last Updated: 26 October 2020
// 7 October 2020: Added gravityring, removed unused structural upgrades.
// 26 October 2020: Changed KiwiAerospace to KiwiTechTree

// "Later" Structural Pieces (Tiers 7-8)
