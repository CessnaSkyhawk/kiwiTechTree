// Kiwi's Tech Tree Overhaul (Making Alternate History Pack by bcink Cryo Engines Patch)
// Version 0.9
// Created: 15 September for KSP 1.9.1
// Last Updated: 29 October 2020
// 29 October 2020: Generalized the ModuleEngines Identifier in B9; ISP Balance on engines


// ***** Liquid Hydrogen / Liquid Methane ***** \\

// Tier 0 - start, just the small jet engine to allow for the aeronautics branch

// Tier 1 - basicCryoRocketry , a basic 0.625m engine that helps get us off the ground

// Tier 2 - generalCryoRocketry ; Stronger 0.625m engine and initial 1.25m engine

// Tier 3 - advancedCryoRocketry ; Intro of the 1.875m engine in Making History
