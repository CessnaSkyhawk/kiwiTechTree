// Kiwi's Tech Tree Overhaul (Mk2 Stockalike Expansion by SuicidalInsanity Upgrades)
// Version 1.0
// Created: 20 September 2020 for KSP 1.9.1
// Last Updated: 11 November 2020
// 25 September 2020: Added NEEDS to PARTUPGRADE
// 25 October 2020: Added upgrade to Mx2 Stationkeeper
// 26 October 2020: Changed KiwiAerospace to KiwiTechTree
// 2 November 2020: Added support for the Mark 1 System Upgrade System
// 9 November 2020: Added standardized engine upgrade support.
// 11 November 2020: Upgrade Cleanup

// ***** Solid Rocket Boosters ***** \\

// Tier 0 - start
// Good starting solid rocket to get off ground, barely

// Tier 1, soundingRockets - looking at just a slightly more powerful 0.625m part

// Tier 2, tinyBoosters - Introduce a 1.25m SRB

// Tier 3, smallBoosters - Some more powerful 1.25m SRB

// Tier 4, mediumBoosters - Intro of a solid 1.875 m booster found within Missing History Patch

// Tier 5, largeBoosters - 2.5m booster

// Tier 6, largerBoosters - Pollux from Making History makes this branch
