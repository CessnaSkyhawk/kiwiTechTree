// Kiwi's Tech Tree Overhaul (Mars Direct by bcink Patch)
// Version 0.9
// Created: 16 September 2020 for KSP 1.9.1
// Last Updated: 26 October 2020
// 25 September 2020: Added NEEDS for PARTUPGRADE
// 26 October 2020: Changed KiwiAerospace to KiwiTechTree

//// ********* Engines ********* \\\\

// ***** Liquid Fuel ***** \\

// Tier 0 - start, just the small jet engine to allow for the aeronautics branch

// Tier 1 - basicRocketry , a basic 0.625m engine that helps get us off the ground

// Tier 2 - generalRocketry ; Stronger 0.625m engine and initial 1.25m engine

// Tier 3 - advRocketry ; Intro of the 1.875m engine in Making History

// Tier 4 - heavyRocketry Heavy Rocketry, Intro of 2.5m engines
