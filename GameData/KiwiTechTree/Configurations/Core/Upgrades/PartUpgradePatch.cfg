// Kiwi's Tech Tree Overhaul (Partupgrade Enhancement)
// Version 1.4
// Created: 22 November 2020 for KSP 1.9.1 to 1.10.1
// Last Updated: 20 January 2021
// 24 November 2020: Consolidated the upgrade settings to one patch to reduce the number of patches impacting all parts.
// This adds 1 kerbuck to the entry cost of part upgrades to make it easier to distinguish from parts.  Also patches in various upgrade settings to all parts.  Too many variations to have nuanced patching, just will brute force here.
// Special thanks to flart for the suggestion.
// 20 January 2021: Removes one entry cost for part upgrades as plugin is more elegant solution.
