// Kiwi's Tech Tree Overhaul (Lithium Fuel Tanks Upgrades)
// Version 1.2
// Created: 31 October 2020 for KSP 1.9.1 to 1.10.1
// Last Updated: 23 November 2020
// 2 November 2020: Added text to identify the location of upgrades in tech tree.
// 10 November 2020: Added Argon, Lithium Gas Upgrade
// 23 November 2020: Fixed typo in tank upgrade description; Added support to disable fuel tank upgrades

// Will add Lithium tanks here
