// Kiwi's Tech Tree Overhaul (Material Upgrade Patches for Stock/Restock+/Near Future Tanks)
// Version 0.9
// Created: August 2020 for KSP 1.9.1
// Last Updated: 29 October 2020
// Notes: 3 September 2020: Modified to add support for Cryotanks
// 14 September 2020: Added Luciole support
// 21 September 2020: Added Kerbal Reusability Expansion Support
// 27 September 2020: Added Knes, Orion, Dodo Labs Support
// 26 October 2020: Changed KiwiAerospace to KiwiTechTree
// 28 October 2020: Added a framework for general upgrades through tagging.
// 29 October 2020: Added check to see if fuel tanks have fuel at the time that the patch is installed when CryoTanks is not installed as some parts have fuel only due to the inclusion of other patches (probably adapters).
// 1 November 2020: Converted the fuel upgrade system to a tagged based system.
