// Kiwi's Tech Tree Overhaul (Structural Parts Stock Upgrades)
// Version 0.9
// Created: 26 August 2020 for KSP 1.9.1
// Last Updated: 1 November 2020
// 28 September 2020: Added a template for Even Later Tier9+ Structural Upgrades which was otherwise only used for Near Future Space Craft and Launch Vehicles as a just in case.
// 21 October 2020: Added a Coatl Aerospace Structural part as too lazy to add a new config just for that.
// 26 October 2020: Changed KiwiAerospace to KiwiTechTree
// 27 October 2020: Added support for general upgrades via declaring a variable
// 1 November 2020: Further generalized the structural upgrade code
// 2 November 2020: Added patch to identify the location of the upgrade within the description!
