// Kiwi's Tech Tree Overhaul (Stock Parts Upgrades)
// Version 0.9
// Created: 24 August 2020 for KSP 1.9.1
// Last Updated: 26 October 2020
// 2 October 2020: Moved Poodle PARTUPGRADE earlier to reflect the change in the part appearance.
// 15 October 2020: Moved Ant and Spider Upgrades to correspond with new tech node placement.
// 25 October 2020: Added Puff Upgrade
// 26 October 2020: Changed KiwiAerospace to KiwiTechTree
// 3 November 2020: Added patches to identify the location of the upgrades.
// 4 November 2020: Fixed duplicate upgrade text in engines with CryoEngines conversion

// Tier 1 - basicRocketry

// Tier 2 - generalRocketry ; Stronger 0.625m engine and initial 1.25m engine

// Tier 3 - advRocketry ; Intro of the 1.875m engine in Making History
