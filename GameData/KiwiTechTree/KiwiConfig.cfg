// Kiwi's Tech Tree Overhaul (General Upgrade Configurations)
// Version 1.0
// Created: 31 October 2020 for KSP 1.9.1 to 1.10.1
// Last Updated: 19 November 2020
// Added general settings for Kerbalism and Engine Ignitor

	ENGINE_IGNITOR_KERBALISM
	{
		BURN_DURATION = On // When Engine Ignitor is installed alongside Kerbalism with Feature Reliability, it will disable's Kerbalism's Ignitor within the module and use only the burn duration.  If turned off, it will disable the reliability module for engines completely.
		FAILURE_PROBABILITY = Off // This will maintain the probability that an engine can fail on start-up in addition to the random probability of failure introduced by Engine Ignitor.  Turning on will likely result in very unreliable engines.
