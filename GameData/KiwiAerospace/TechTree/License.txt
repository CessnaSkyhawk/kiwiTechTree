### Additional Licenses and attributions:
Core tech tree configuration files are based on files originally created by _Zee and redistributed under the same MIT license. Additional config files are likely to be influenced by their respective mod creators and the respective licenses of the config files are noted within the mod files within each subfolder in GameData\KiwiAerospace\TechTree\Configurations\Mods.  While some mods have no derivative requirements, I have not bundled code from those mods.  Any mod author who would like me to remove a configuration for their mod, please get in touch irrespective of your mods license requirements.

Some icons from Community Tech Tree by Nertea were modified bundled in this mod.  They are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0.

Additional icons used within the tech tree were modified from icons sourced from flaticon.com and thenounproject.com.  I purchased these as a premium member of these services.
