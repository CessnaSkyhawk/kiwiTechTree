A CTT "Probes/Planes Before Crew" type Overhaul based on the Zee's [PBC Mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/181013-ksp-181-probes-before-crew-pbc-version-28/) and also inspired by Spink Akron's [UnKerballed Start](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/181932-18x-unkerballed-start-v110-updated-oct-27-2019/). Requires the Community Tech Tree: [CTT](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/90530-110x-community-tech-tree-august-1-2020/).

This overhaul, like its predecessors, takes the basic premise that probes should come before crewed space missions.  While I really enjoyed both aforementioned mods, I found two issues: It took a bit too long to see my kerbals in game and I could get a good way through the tech tree before leaving Kerbin/Mun/Minmus.  

This is an attempt to make my tech choices a bit more meaningful and allow me to have my kerbins spend some time testing jets in Kerbin's atmosphere before launching in space.  I have added another 62 tech nodes across the tree, but have tried to leave the general layout of the tree largely intact.  The major changes are adding a separate branch for solid rocket boosters and if you have mods which have cryogenic engines, this will move them to a different branch from the Liquid Fuel Branch. While I have shifted some of the nodes around, I have not removed any, thus leaving some compatibility with any mod that I have not explictly linked here (which as of now is functionally none).

Like UnKerballed Start, I have started with 0.625 meter engines and tanks and worked progressively larger.  

I calibrated the basic idea around stock and the expansion packs alongside Restock+ and Missing History.  Ultimately, given the number of nodes, you will benefit by having several parts mods.

The mods that I am looking at incorporating if changes necessary in the current order of preference: 
1. Nertea's Full Suite of Parts mods excluding Far Future due to his current revamp
2. DMagic Orbital Science
3. Universal Storage 2
4. Luciole
5. B9 Procedural Wings
6. AirplanePlus
7. Stockalike Mk1 Open cockpit
8. Mk2/Mk3 Expansion
9. Rational Resources
10. MKS
11. Knes
12. KIS/KAS
13. Stockish Project Orion
14. Mining Expansion

While BDB and Tantares, and Kerbalism are really amazing mods, their scope is intimidating.  More than happy to accept help on this front if anyone is interested.

0.1.1 Added MkIV Spaceplane Support, Part Upgrades to Mk1-3 Plane systems to discourage those being used for the first crewed space missions.
